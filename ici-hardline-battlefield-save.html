I'm counting the days until BF5 and the joke that is BF1 can cease to be in my mind. It contains nothing I like and is full of shit mechanics I hate, like the god like planes that go 55 and 4 every match. Or the "skill based" sweetspot mechanic, that rewards you for standing in the right place and hitting a person in their chest. Or the Q spotting that you can spam til your hearts content.

More and more players (especially the good and loyal players) are turning their backs on Battlefield. The other half complains where they can. And in between there are still a few faithful and longtime Battlefield players who still believe in Battlefield. What this sad development is about and how Battlefield can save the sinking ship, I would like to underline once with my feedback. amp#x200B; 1. Singleplayer, CombinedArms Battlefield is still perceived by the community as a multiplayer. A five-volume series released between 1995 and 2002, Paul Kearney's Monarchies of God remains one of the more perennially underread works in the epic fantasy genre, despite its impressive quality. The setting is the continent of Normannia, which is a standard European fantasyland stand-in with one major, notable difference. Rather than being set in the world's equivalent of the Middle-Ages-but-with-magic, The Monarchies of God is set in the equivalent of the Renaissance. Gunpowder weapo. ##### Just for validation purposes before I start (around 2-3 hours of this is AFK or in the menus) (https://i.imgur.com/gGvnjKB.png). --- I won't be going into detail much about certain bugs or glitches. I also want to pretense this by saying that the most recent trailer for the game has been the only great representation of it so far. The first two were rather bad in that regard. As everyone likes to mention it, I have been playing Battlefield since Battlefield 2. I did not play Hardlin. Day 10 edit: Still trying to keep up with new information 10 days later, please let me know if I've missed anything or got anything wrong! I had no idea what to title this. Let me start off by saying this is large post. I have tried to title most of what I can so skip ahead and read what interests you if you wish. Feel free to tell me if I've missed anything, I expect I have. There's so much new stuff and so much has definitely changed for the greater good that I'm just so damn excited. I can't. Historical Accuracy in the Battlefield franchise History has been used as a tool to convey messaging and immures players into the game world. This has typically been done by adding known locations, weapons, vehicles and objects to the game to make the story believable. When we see something familiar like a setting or items within the game we may have a deeper sense of connection with the story or characters. The franchise has never attempted to be historically accurate outside map locati. Such a great game with so much potential. getting ruined by lack of QA and updates to bring customers in and keep current players happy. That about sums it up sadly as the life and quality of Battlefield games have been on a rapid decline lately. The biggest thing that has killed Dice and their Battlefield game franchise was selling out to EA and joining them. QA dropped, content varies per game as does the decisions to keep a consistent standard to the "Battlefield" line of games. I have been a fan of the Battlefield franchise for a long time. I played Bad Company, racked up more time on Battlefield 4 than I have being married, and even bought Premium when they threw Battlefield Hardline at us.

I've been a huge Battlefield fan ever since 1942, playing nearly every entry in the franchise save for a couple of the fringe ones, and I'm reminded of just how much I love each iteration of this incredible franchise, but specifically BF1. I know the subject is sorely contested among the community, but as we close in on BFV, I just wanted to take a minute to pay homage to what is (IMO) a unique and worthy entry in a wonderful game series. For one, I have more hours logged in BF1 than any other. Dont get me wrong, so far I love the game and Im having a blast with it. The fact that there is so many issues that are extremely annoying makes me pretty confused tho, I havent played BF since BF4, and I didnt play that one at launch. Not sure how Hardline or BF1 played out in the beginning, but its 2018/2019 and I wouldnt expect a huge game like this to struggle with such basic things. I will give you a short list below, and people who have been playing for abit will definitely Hey, everyone! This is my VERY FIRST POST. Never used reddit before.
