Hi, i'm a "new" warcraft 3 player (never played seriously even tho i played as a kid and did some custom games every once in a while since it came out, but we are trying to be good enough for bnet/wc3arena with some friends) and i have a some questions.

My objective in creating this post is to get an idea of how this MU is supposed to play out and where my current understanding of it is flawed or needs to be updated. I currently play as an NE player on WC3arena and struggle the most with this MU. I just started playing again after at least a 3 year break.

So here is how I remember most of my games playing How to Install Warcraft 3 Tft Nocd Patch 120E.

hey all. Haven't played wc3 in years but re bought online version of roc and ft a few days ago. I'm prob not good enough for wc3arena but what server do most people play on? My favorite is 4v4s but I haven't been able to find one game. Only some 3v3s. I don't play customs. Looking for some casual games for nostalgic fun. Also, do I lag more if I am in the U.S. And play on a foreign server? Thanks. forum.readmore.de. I was watching vods of the competitive games and it hyped me up so much to play. Then I bought the game (I didn't expect to be good btw, I just wanted to practice and play for fun) and started it up. I played some bot games for practice. I queue'd up on battlenet and had tremendous lag on useast where I live. So I figured it was just bnet. So I got wc3arena and it was less laggy, but still nothing near the single player game ping. Was just wondering if this is the case for most people? What Warcraft 3 patch do you need to play online?. This is a list with the latest Warcraft 3 patches, these are the most popular updates to play on the internet. The threads for the past couple months (as long as I've been playing) have been increasingly positive/helpful. Just know people out there appreciate it! Also, I have noticed a few threads asking if one should use Wc3arena or Battlenet. While i'm still a new player, I use Wc3arena. I don't think people should be scared away from using Wc3a because of the good players on the ladder. Trust me, there are people worse than you.
